# FindYourHat


Mini-Project completed for a course on Codecademy.com

Plays a maze game in the terminal when you run "node main.js"

The objective of the game is to navigate the player to the hat icon '^', which will be displayed on the game board.

You have to do so while avoiding all the various holes 'O' strewn throughout the map. The user gets to decide roughly how many holes there will be as well as the map size before playing.

Each instance of the "node main.js" command will play exactly 1 game, ending when the player successfully gets to the hat, hits a hole, leaves the game boundaries, or tries to re-use a path they already traveled.

Happy Playing!!
